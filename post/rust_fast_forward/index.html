<h2 id="the-real-reason-i-got-into-rust">The real reason I got into rust</h2>

<p>So system level languages have always seemed a bit out of my grasp. The opportunity to use it and my willingness to learn
and the learning curve of something as verbose as C or C++ would be the main hurdles I encountered.
Having made javascript my home and the frontend frameworks the torture chambers under it. I feel I have
gathered enough of the technical knowhow and discpline to add a system language to my belt of skills.</p>

<p>The previous rust posts gave everyone a glimpse of how I learn in a test driven environment. So the first thing I
wanted to do was setup and understand my debugging and testing tools.</p>

<p>So this is going to be an introduction to what I am going to be using on this adventure of showing my new found
rust super powers physically in the embedded realm.</p>

<p>Up and center we have openOCD. The description of this tool is <code>Free and Open On-Chip Debugging, In-System Programming and Boundary-Scan Testing</code>
I am only begging to grasp what it does but by fiddling with it all weekend it seems to be the software bridge between
the ST-LINK and my computer.</p>

<p>Next ST-LINK. simple usb looking like device that allows you to connect a microcontroller of the stm variety to a laptop.</p>

<p>Then followed by arm-none-eabi-gdb. The debug software that will allow us to run and inspect our rust code</p>

<p>In the following post I will describe how we combine all the above tools to understand the rust code running on
a bluepill device.</p>
