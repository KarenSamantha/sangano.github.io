<p>Today I am going to introduce things I did not understood clearly when I first encountered them.
The first is Higher Order Reducer and the second is the Redux middleware. I already know
what most of you are already saying, you do not need Redux and even Dan Abramov
co-author of Redux wrote an article titled <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">you might not need redux</a>.
Sometimes I go overboard with applying tools and frameworks to my problems, The &ldquo;to a hammer everything looks like a nail&rdquo; type of habit. I do
however feel like this villain has superpowers worthy to be studied.</p>

<p>In the spirit of approaching everything as a student. We will break this down into the following sections</p>

<ul>
<li>Example of main feature/superpower</li>
<li>Example of how to test</li>
<li>Example of how to extend</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-redux-middleware">The redux middleware</h3>

<p>A loose interpretation of the documentation describe Redux middleware as functions that are composed. Any data sent to the Redux store is passed
through this tunnel of functions and just like koa or express middleware you could either fire off a side-effect, manipulate the object before passing
it along to the next and or even do nothing. Without further delay the perfect beginner example of a middleware used in the documentation is the logger</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const logger = store =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; {
  console.log('dispatching', action)
  let result = next(action)
  console.log('next state', store.getState())
  return result
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above is what you more or less get when you run <code>npm install redux-logger</code>. Now disregarding the first line of the above code which is basically
the middleware template. We notice that our first line just logs out the action/object that was passed to it. At this point we have the chance to manipulate
the object before passing it along. With a chain of middlewares this next method is called until we reach the store. In any middleware we do that by calling
<code>next(action)</code>. On successfully apply the action to the state via the reducer. The middlewares we all start to return one after the other until whatever functions
called dispatch. At this stage in every middleware, we have another chance to do something. The below are examples of what you can do withing the scope of this
function either before the new state is formed or after.</p>

<ul>
<li>fire off a side-effect maybe ping some analytics service.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-js">  const logger = store =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; {
    console.log('dispatching', action)
    localStorage.setItem('top', 'gun'); // &lt;&lt; Side-effect before state is formed
    let result = next(action)
    cosnt newStore = store.getState();
    localStorage.setItem('top', 'gun'); // &lt;&lt; Side-effect after state is formed
    console.log('next state', newStore)
    return result
  }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>redirect the flow by calling next(action) using a new action.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-js">  const logger = store =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; {
    console.log('dispatching', action)
    let result = next(action)
    result = next(action2) // &lt;&lt; Provide another action for the reducer before returning
    console.log('next state', store.getState())
    return result
  }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>return the output from calling next(action) to the previous middleware.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that within the function before calling <code>next()</code>, you have access to the store which you can save in a variable and access it after
calling <code>next()</code>. Things like conditionally applying actions based on the state, comparing old and new store state or even firing new action based on the new state are
all possible and are abstracted away in a simple to test middleware. An example of a possible use-case would be AddToBasket function. This would be a customer action that
e-commerce companies are interested in so we either inline the some analytics logic to register this event with an analytics service or we separate concerns and abstract
the analytics via a function that we call from the AddToBasket logic. Although simple and clean to understand the problem becomes noticeable when the application becomes
large enough that you have a lot of these analytics functions being executed everywhere. Now imagine having a simple middleware that does one thing and one thing only
fire an addToBasket event every time we send an action to the store to add something to the basket</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">  const analyticsMiddleware = store =&gt; next =&gt; async action =&gt; {
    let result = next(action)
    if(action.type === 'ADD_TO_BASKET') {
      sneakyAnalytics.sendEvent('AddToCart')
    }
    return result
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The addition of this middleware would capture all current and future features that would execute the store&rsquo;s <code>ADD_TO_BASKET</code> action and is very easy to remove or swap out.</p>

<p>In the next post we will look at testing and extending middlewares.</p>
