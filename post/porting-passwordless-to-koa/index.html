<h3 id="porting-passwordless-to-koa"><strong>Porting passwordless to koa</strong></h3>

<p>Every now and then you bump into a project that is really cool but is very much incompatible with the framework of your choice. For me, <a href="passwordless">https://passwordless.net/</a> is one of those projects. The project itself was created by <a href="Florian Heinemann">https://twitter.com/thesumofall</a> and primarily for <a href="express">https://expressjs.com/</a>This project is also a couple years old and although it is perfect and works flawlessly with <a href="express">https://expressjs.com/</a>, it is a prime candidate to practice my refactoring skills and all the stuff encouraged by the development community. So, we will be focusing on a test driven development approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On top of the test driven development we will completely move toward es6 and async/await type syntax for the library to make it more aligned with the koa syntax.</p>

<p>Stick around for the next couple of posts.</p>
