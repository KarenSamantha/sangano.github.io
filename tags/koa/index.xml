      <description>Porting passwordless to koa Every now and then you bump into a project that is really cool but is very much incompatible with the framework of your choice. For me, https://passwordless.net/ is one of those projects. The project itself was created by https://twitter.com/thesumofall and primarily for https://expressjs.com/This project is also a couple years old and although it is perfect and works flawlessly with https://expressjs.com/, it is a prime candidate to practice my refactoring skills and all the stuff encouraged by the development community.</description>
