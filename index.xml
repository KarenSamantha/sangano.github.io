      <description>The real reason I got into rust So system level languages have always seemed a bit out of my grasp. The opportunity to use it and my willingness to learn and the learning curve of something as verbose as C or C++ would be the main hurdles I encountered. Having made javascript my home and the frontend frameworks the torture chambers under it. I feel I have gathered enough of the technical knowhow and discpline to add a system language to my belt of skills.</description>

      <description>The basics of testing in rust I once read somewhere that code without tests is bad code. Although testing is a big part of code development we seem to learn it last so I am gonna flip that and start my rusty adventure with first learning how to test my code snippets. After going over the rust book once just to get a feel my study routine will start on chapter 11.</description>

      <description>I have been a rust hobbyist for a little over 3 months now and coming from javascript my learning process has been driven by my experience of learning by doing. To make the process a bit smoother I will apply the test driven development approach and setup my environmnet to reduce the time validate builds.
The tools  Neovim Vimtest Vimux  The above tools will run an test I have in the files whenever I save the file or trigger the function using the mapped keys.</description>
